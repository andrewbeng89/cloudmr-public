Cloud MReduce
=======

Hey folks,

Well to really honest, Mapreduce has been quite tough on all of us; getting the concepts and actually writing the 
code.Having gone through a less than pleasant experience picking it up on our own, we thought that this shouldn't 
happen to to other people. What we really needed was some way to quickly grasp the concept and at the same time get 
really quick feedback.

We gladly took the opportunity when our awesome Professor Chris release the different projects we could work on. 
And as they say it, the rest is history.

We really hope you'll play around with the stuff we've created and in the process gain attain the super power
of mapping and reducing!

Love,
Team MReduce
